const DEVLOG_0 = `
# Devlog 0

It's kind of crazy to call this a devlog 0 when I've been working on this website for days at this point. I've gone back and forth with different ideas, implementations, environment setup and a bunch of other stuff. But I supposed I should begin with describing the idea and why I'm doing this.

It all started when I saw the [React95](https://github.com/React95/React95) github page and I was like: "Hey, that looks cool", os I decided to play around with it. I was aware of this project for a long time but didn't really think about it too much. Honestly, I'm not quite sure why I decided to give it a go this time but hey, I guess there really is a time and place for everything.
